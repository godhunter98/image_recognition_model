# This is my implementation of a modern Convolution Neural Net trained to identify images of fashion clothing

Fashion clothing included bags, sneakers, shirts, tshirts and many more categories.
The model has been trained on 10,000 images and works with 98% accuracy while inferencing.

## The model weights are also provided and are free to download. 

Note: It's an interesting side project if someone wants to take the pretrained model and train it on much more fashion images.
